<p dir="ltr">ACES Coders, organized by the Association of Computer Engineering Students (ACES), stands as the premier annual competitive coding competition in Sri Lanka. Originating thirteen years ago, ACES Coders began as a practice event to prepare Computer Engineering students at the University of Peradeniya for participation in similar online programming contests like IEEEXtreme and ACM ICPC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event spanned approximately 17 hours, beginning with the Opening Ceremony on the 5th of October, followed by the competition that continued overnight and concluded with the Closing Ceremony on the 6th of October. A total of 91 teams, comprising 267 participants, took part in the competition. The champions of the event were Insomniacs from the University of Peradeniya, while WeWillWin from the University of Moratuwa emerged as the first runner-up, and SurgicalMasks, also from the University of Moratuwa, secured the position of second runner-up. The event was held at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya, utilizing venues including EOE, DO1, and Lecture Halls 7 and 8. The 11th version, ACES Coders V11.0 is bigger and better than ever. In this 12-hour challenge, participants will solve many problems using their coding skills. This fast-paced event pushes everyone to be more efficient and accurate.</p>
