<p dir="ltr">Line Quest 1.0 is an open competition for school students from all over the country. In this competition, students design and build a line-following robot using Arduino microcontrollers to show their skills and creativity. The event started at 07.00 AM and ended at 05.30 PM on 05th of October 2024 at the Floor, New Mechanical Building, Faculty of Engineering</p>
<p dir="ltr">Project Nenathambara, together with ACES, organized the Nenathambara Workshop Series to introduce school students to electronics and Arduino programming. It began with an in-person workshop at the University of Peradeniya and included a teacher seminar to support classroom learning. Schools received Arduino kits for continued practice, followed by an online workshop series for 12 schools, conducted in both Sinhala and Tamil. The nine sessions covered Tinkercad basics, LED projects, sensors, and digital displays. Overall, the program fostered hands-on learning, creativity, and problem-solving while equipping both students and teachers with practical knowledge in electronics and programming. The number of schools participated for the initial in-person workshop is 13 and also 13 schools actively participated in the competition.&nbsp;</p>
