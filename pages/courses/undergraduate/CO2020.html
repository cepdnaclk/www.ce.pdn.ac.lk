  Introduction to Networking

  What is the internet, the network edge and core, packet-switched networks, network

  performance measurement, layered architecture and service models, networks under
  attack

  Application Layer

  Network applications and their requirements: web and HTTP, FTP, email, DNS, peer-to-peer

  applications, video conferencing, content distribution networks, and other emerging

  applications.

  Network Application Development

  Introduction to UDP and TCP, client-server model, socket programming and network

  applications.

  Transport Layer

  Transport layer services, connectionless transport: UDP, principles of reliable
  data transfer,

  connection-oriented transport: TCP, principles of congestion Control, TCP congestion
  control,

  evolution of transport-layer functionality.

  Network Layer: Data Plane

  Forwarding and routing: network data and control planes, network service models,
  router

  design principles, IP design principles, generalized forwarding and SDN, middleboxes:

  firewalls, NATs, DPIs and load balancers.

  Network Layer: Control Plane

  Routing algorithms, Intra-AS routing, exterior gateway protocols: role, design principles
  and

  practice, SDN control plane, ICMP, and network management.

  Link Layer and LANs

  Link layer services, error detection and correction, multiple access links and protocols

aims_and_objectives: "\u25CF The goal of this course is to provide a fundamental view\
  \ behind the general purpose\ncomputer networks: the principles upon which the Internet\
  \ and most other computer\nnetworks are built; how those principles translate into\
  \ deployed protocols; and hands-on\nexperience solving challenging problems with\
  \ network protocols.\n\u25CF This course provides an introduction to fundamental\
  \ concepts in the design and\nimplementation of computer networks, their protocols,\
  \ and applications."
