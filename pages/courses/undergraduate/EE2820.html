course_content: "Operational Amplifiers (OPAMP)\nThe ideal OPAMP, open-loop gain,\
  \ input resistance and output resistance. Characteristics of real\nOp-Amps: open-loop\
  \ transfer function, voltage gain, bandwidth, slew rate, power bandwidth,\nclipping,\
  \ offset voltages and currents, rejection ratios.\nOPAMP Applications\nLinear applications:\
  \ (Inverting and Non- Inverting amplifiers, Differential and Summing amplifiers,\n\
  Integrators and Differentiators), Nonlinear applications (precision rectifiers,\
  \ peak detectors,\nSchmitt-trigger comparator and logarithmic amplifiers).\nActive\
  \ Filters\nLow-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-stop sections, Butterworth, Chebyshev,\
  \ Elliptic and\nBessel functions, circuit realization of single pole and two-pole\
  \ transfer functions; frequency and\nimpedance scaling. Implementation of filters\
  \ using OPAMPs.\nData conversion circuits\nAnalog to Digital converters: definitions,\
  \ codes, LSB, MSB, linearity, differential linearity, offset\nand gain errors, missing\
  \ codes; Counting converters: successive approximations, single-and-dual\nslope\
  \ converters, flash converters, delta-sigma converters; Sample-and-hold circuits,\
  \ sampling rate\nselection and setting, integrating an analog signal to a digital\
  \ system.Digital to Analog converters: definitions, codes, LSB, MSB, linearity,\
  \ differential linearity, offset\nand gain errors; weighted resistor D/A converter;\
  \ R/2R ladders and D/A converters; weighted\ncurrent source converters; integrating\
  \ a digital signal to an analog system.\nClock synchronizing the Analog to Digital\
  \ and Digital to Analog conversion operations using\nsystem clock signals.\nOscillators\n\
  Basic concepts and definitions; Wien-bridge oscillator\nCircuit modeling and simulation\n\
  Introduction to electronic Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools, dc analysis, ac analysis,\
  \ transient\nanalysis; simulation control options, built-in-solid-state device models,\
  \ device parameter control\nlibraries, Designing electronic circuits.\nLogic Circuits\n\
  SOP and POS representation for logic functions, K-map representation, simplification\
  \ of logic\nfunctions using K-map, minimization of logical functions, don\u2019\
  t care conditions.\nFlip flops, latches, edge triggered flip flops, master slave\
  \ flip flops. Flip flop applications in data\nstorage, shift registers and counters.\n\
