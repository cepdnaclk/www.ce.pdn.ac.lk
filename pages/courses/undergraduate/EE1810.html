- 'ILO1: Apply the knowledge of matrices, Gaussian reduction and determinants to solve

  systems of linear equations.

  ILO2: Apply the properties of vector spaces and to generalize the concepts of Euclidean

  geometry to arbitrary vector spaces.

  ILO3: Identify linear transformations, represent them in terms of matrices, and
  interpret

  their geometric aspects.

  ILO4: Calculate eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of matrices and linear transformations
  and

  apply the concepts in physical situations.

  ILO5: Prove eigenvalue properties of real symmetric matrices and apply them in

  quadratic forms.'
