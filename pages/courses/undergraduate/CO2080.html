  Revising the layered architecture and overall operation of a network; a day in the
  life of a web

  page request; network troubleshooting analysis.

  Network Design and Configuration: Principles and Practice

  Ethernet/IEEE 802.3, multiple-access protocols (CSMA/CD), switched LANs: link-layer

  addressing and ARP, link-layer (L2) switches: basic and advanced functionality,
  VLANs, IP,

  forwarding and routing, subnetting and supernetting, VLANs vs subnets, network-layer
  (L3)

  switches, routers, routing principles, and network diagnostics: fundamentals and
  tools.Network Design and Configuration: Campus Networks

  Complex designs with switched LANs, link-layer (L2) switches, VLANs, network-layer
  (L3)

  switches, and routers.

  Network Programming Project

  Layered network application development: blocking and non-blocking calls, IO multiplexing,

  signal handling, asynchronous IO, IP header options (e.g., timestamping).

  Retrospection

  Reliability, flow-control, addressing, multiplexing/demultiplexing across layers:
  a

  comparative analysis; networking troubleshooting roundup.'
