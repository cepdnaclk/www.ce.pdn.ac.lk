  assembled and linked), stored in memory and executed in a computer system;

  ILO2: interpret and write assembly language programs based on a specified ISA;

  ILO3: independently use the C programming language to write computer programs with

  memory and I/O operations, build and run them in a Linux text-based environment;

  ILO4: use debugging and testing techniques to understand the execution of computer

  programs and identify errors;

  ILO5: demonstrate good practices in programming such as pre-planning, naming
