course_title: Data Structures and Algorithms I
curriculum: Curriculum - Effective from E22
semester: Semester 2
course_content: "Algorithm analysis:

  Empirical measuring of algorithm performance, Running time vs. time complexity,

  asymptotic analysis (Big-O/Big-Omega/Big-Theta notations), time complexity of

  recursive algorithms, master theorem, space efficiency.

  Search and sort strategies:

  Linear search, concept of divide and conquer using binary search, efficiency of
  search

  (sorted vs unsorted linear data), analysis of sorting algorithms: bubble-sort; selection-sort

  (greedy algorithms); insertion-sort (dynamic programming); quick-sort and merge-sort

  (divide and conquer).

  Linear data structures:Introduction to abstract data types (ADT) as opposed to data
  structures, the list ADT,

  linked vs array based implementations, efficiency of list search and maintenance

  operations, stack and queue data structures and their applications, implementation
  using

  different programming languages."
