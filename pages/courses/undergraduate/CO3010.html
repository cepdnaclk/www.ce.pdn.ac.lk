  Introduction to embedded systems

  Embedded systems and their applications, characteristics and metrics: dependability

  (availability, reliability, safety, security); efficiency (energy, cost, resource
  utilization,

  size/weight, latency/throughput), event-driven architecture and state machines,
  embedded

  systems classifications and controller platform types, peripheral devices.

  Microcontrollers

  Features and applications of microcontrollers, architecture, instructions and addressing
  modes,

  memory organization of microcontrollers (program memory, data memory, EEPROM, banked

  and linear memory architectures), programming process and bootup, assembly and C
  language in programming microcontrollers, debugging, general purpose I/O ports and
  pins, I/O pin

  configuration (input, strong drive, weak pullup/pulldown, open-drain, tri-state),
  using parallel

  I/O for peripheral interfacing (keypads, LCDs, etc.).

  Interrupts

  Interrupt system (implementation and usage), interrupt vectors and service routines,
  priority

  and nesting, interrupts vs. polling, data buffering.

  Timing and waveform generation

  Timer/counter device operation, timing accuracy, waveform generation,

  pulse-width-modulation, PWM applications

  Data acquisition and control

  Digital vs analog signals, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and digital-to-analog

  conversion (DAC), ADC and DAC characteristics (sampling rate, reference voltage,

  conversion time, precision, range, encoding method), ADC and DAC architectures,
  sensors

  and sensing physical qualities, actuators and control of physical quantity

  Serial communication

  Parallel vs serial I/O, half duplex and full duplex communication, asynchronous
  and

  synchronous communication, single-ended and differential signaling, standard protocols
  and

  applications (SPI, I2C, UART, USART, RS232, RS485, USB, CAN), implementation details

  of a selection of representative communication protocols.

  Mobile and networked embedded systems

  Networked embedded systems, topologies, data and control flow, wired and wireless

  connectivity, low-power operation techniques, data security and persistent storage
  (EEPROM,

  Flash, SD card, etc.)

  Industrial standards

  Platform/interface independent communication, MQTT, IEEE-488 and IVI standards,

  SCADA, OPC UA, PLCs, industrial ethernet, MODBUS, PROFIBUS, PROFINET, ASi,

  implementation details of selected industry standard protocols
