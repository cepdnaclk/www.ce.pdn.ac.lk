aims_and_objectives: Use a problem-based approach to introduce the tools and techniques
  afforded by high-level languages, standard libraries and operating systems so that
  students will be able to use these primitives while constructing relatively large
  software.

ilos_knowledge:
- 'At the end of this course, a student will be able to;

  Choose an appropriate data collection for efficiently representing a problem''s
  data and its associated computations.

  Apply declarative programming to data-intensive problems.

  Use objects or algebraic data types to construct a suitable data representation
  for problems involving trees and graphs.

  Identify opportunities for concurrency in existing code or a problem description.

  Cleanly separate user interface and input/output concerns from core program logic.'
ilos_skills:
- 'At the end of this course, a student will be able to;

  Scan and parse unstructured and structured textual formats to extract data.

  Traverse a linked data structure to perform a computation.

  Write a simple network client (e.g. web crawler).

  Build programs usable via multiple interfaces (command-line, GUI.)

  Write secure, testable and modular code.

  '
ilos_attitudes:
- "Use the right tool/technique for the job.\nDo one thing and do it well (UNIX \u201C\
  tiny tools\u201D philosophy)."
