    conventions, addressing modes, software interrupts, comparison of CISC and RISC\n\
    programmer models.\nCPU organization\nImplementation of the Von Neumann machine\
    \ using a specified ISA, datapath and control,\nregister file, arithmetic and\
    \ logic unit, control unit, instruction fetching and decoding,\nexecution of instructions\
    \ in a single-cycle datapath, timing and clocking, critical path and\nperformance\
    \ considerations, implementation of a single-cycle CPU using Verilog HDL\nbehavioral\
    \ modeling.\nPipelined datapath and control\nIntroduction to pipelining and instruction\
    \ level parallelism, datapath and control in a pipelined\nCPU using specified\
