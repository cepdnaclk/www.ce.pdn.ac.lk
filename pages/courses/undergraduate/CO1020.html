course_title: Computer Systems Programming
curriculum: Curriculum - Effective from E22
semester: Semester 2
course_content: 'Overview of computer systems and the programming process:

  Abstractions in software (from algorithms to machine code) and hardware (from silicon
  to

  microarchitecture), Von Neumann machine concept, organization of a computer system

  (application software, system software, instructions & microarchitecture, memory,
  peripheral

  hardware such as secondary storage and networking, firmware), the process of building
  and

  executing programs (pre-processing, compiling, assembling, linking, storing/loading,
  execution

  in a GNU/Linux environment)Introduction to C programming syntax:

  Comments, variables, data types, type casting, operators, expressions, flow control
  (conditions,

  loops, interrupting loop flow, program termination), statements & blocks, library
  functions,

  basic user inputs & outputs.

  Structured programming:

  Functions syntax, naming conventions, parameter passing by value and reference,
  recursion.

  Error detection and prevention:

  Syntax/semantic/logical errors, compile-time/run-time errors, assertions, debugging
  tools (GNU

  debugger), good practices in programming, testing to verify correctness using proper
  test cases.

  Memory allocation and peripheral I/O:

  Memory layout (stack, heap, global data, code/text), stack tracing for debugging,
  static memory

  allocation, arrays, string representation, string manipulation, pointers, structures,
  file input and

  output, network socket programming.

  Assembly language programming:

  Introduction to assembly syntax using a specified ISA, integer arithmetic and logic
  operations

  using register/immediate operands, branching and conditional execution, function
  calls, register

  conventions, stack operations, nested calls, accessing data memory.'

ilos_general:
- 'ILO1: describe how computer programs are written, built (pre-processed, compiled,

  assembled and linked), stored in memory and executed in a computer system;

  ILO2: interpret and write assembly language programs based on a specified ISA;

  ILO3: independently use the C programming language to write computer programs with

  memory and I/O operations, build and run them in a Linux text-based environment;

  ILO4: use debugging and testing techniques to understand the execution of computer

  programs and identify errors;

  ILO5: demonstrate good practices in programming such as pre-planning, naming

  conventions, commenting, modularization and testing in order to write high quality

  and efficient code.'
