  description: 'Course Content: (Only main topics & subtopics)

    Introduction to Computer Systems Security

    Importance of computer systems security (history, breaches and impact), basic
    concepts, threat

    models, common security goals.

    Cryptography Basics

    Introduction, modern cryptographic protocols (and their history, applications,
    depreciation),

    encryption, authentication, message authentication codes, hash functions, one-way
    functions,

    secret and public-key cryptography, secure channels, zero-knowledge proof, integration
    of

    cryptographic protocols into distributed systems and other applications.

    Software Security

    Importance of software security, authentication vs authorization and their importance,

    sandboxing.

    Network SecurityImportance, secure protocols (TCP/IP), firewalls, network segmentation,
    intrusion and

    detection.

    Web Security

    Importance of web security, SSL, HTTPS, basic authentication, oauth2, authorization
    and fine

    grain permission validation (OPA, XACML), SSO (SAML).

    Hardware Security

    Hardware security modules, side-channel attacks, hardware trojans

    Advanced Topics

    A selection of modern topics such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, privacy and
    secure

    communications, trusted computing, mobile security, operating systems security,
