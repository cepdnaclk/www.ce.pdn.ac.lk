curriculum: Current Curriculum
semester: Semester 3
course_content: ''
credits: 3
type: Core
prerequisites: []
aims_and_objectives: To introduce digital electronics with emphasis on practical design
  techniques for digital circuits, analysis of static and dynamic behaviour of digital
  circuits and optimized circuit implementation; its principles in Boolean algebra
  and the design of combinational and sequential circuits with implementation at logic
  circuit level. Also to teach how simple combinational and sequential modules are
  used to build complete systems, reflecting real-world digital design.

ilos_general: []
ilos_knowledge:
- Perform Boolean manipulation, circuit minimization and synthesis of sequential and
  combinational circuits.
- Analyse static and dynamic behaviour of digital circuits.
ilos_skills:
- Draw up the formal requirement specification starting from an informal requirement.
- Design and implement basic combinational and sequential circuits with considerations
  to common problems such as hazards, race conditions and instability in these circuits.
- Demonstrate the conformance of a design to its specifications including temporal
  behaviour.
ilos_attitudes:
- The student must have developed sufficient confidence to be able to undertake digital
  circuit design for real-world engineering requirements by acquiring any further
  domain knowledge through self-study.
- Discourage trial and error implementation of the circuits.
