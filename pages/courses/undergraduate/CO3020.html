- 'ILO1: describe the role of an OS as a resource manager and a service provider for
  application

  execution;

  ILO2: describe basic OS concepts and abstractions (such as processes and threads,
  address

  spaces, files, input/output and information protection) and their implementation;

  ILO3: critique the tradeoffs involved with realizing the OS concepts on actual hardware.'
