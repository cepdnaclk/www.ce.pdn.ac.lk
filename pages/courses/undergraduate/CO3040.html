  description: "Course Content: (Only main topics & subtopics)\nNetworked application\
    \ preliminaries\nClient-server vs peer-to-peer architecture, datagram vs. stream\
    \ oriented sockets, data\nserialization: binary vs. text., synchronous (request-response)\
    \ vs. asynchronous\n(message-oriented) application protocols, Deutsch\u2019s fallacies\
    \ of distributed computing.\nRequest-response protocols\nHTTP request structure\
    \ and response structure, metadata and status codes, text serialization\nformats:\
    \ JSON.\nConcurrency\nConcurrency model: processes, threads, coroutines (event\
    \ driven I/O.), data races and mutual\nexclusion, race conditions and transactions,\
    \ statelessness and idempotence, modeling stateful\nservices with finite automata\n\
    Remote procedure calls\nRPC abstraction and interface definition languages.\n\
    RPC failure modes.\nBinary serialization formats: Protocol buffers.\nAsynchronous\
    \ coordination\nPublish-subscribe protocols: MQTT, message brokers (topics and\
    \ message routing), message\ndelivery semantics (MQTT QoS): at least once, at\
    \ most once, exactly once.\nDistributed data storage\nStreaming datastores: distributed\
    \ commit logs, BLOB storage: distributed hash tables\n(key-value stores.), replicas\
    \ and partitions (shards.), consistency models, Brewer\u2019s CAP\ntheorem.\n\
    Application security\nThreat models (STRIDE), abuse cases and common application\
    \ vulnerabilities, protocols for\nweb application access control (Oauth) and authentication\
    \ (Webauthn.), security\nconsiderations for \u201CIoT\u201D devices (mutual authentication,\
    \ root of trust.)\nProvisioning and deployment\nCloud platforms: infrastructure\
    \ as a service vs. platform as a service, infrastructure as code:\ndeclarative\
    \ vs imperative provisioning tools, application packaging: dependency management\n\
    and containers.\nOperability and observability\nDefining service level objectives,\
    \ application logging, metrics and alerting, container\norchestration: declarative\
    \ deployment, rollback and self-healing, incident postmortem and root\ncause analysis."
