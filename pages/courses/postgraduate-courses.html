<h3>Postgraduate Research Degrees in Computer Engineering</h3>

<p>
  The Department of Computer Engineering is accepting applications for Postgraduate Research
  Programmes in relevant fields. The research-based degrees offered by the Faculty of Engineering
  are Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). Postgraduate research
  programmes are based entirely on research and completion of a dissertation under the guidance of
  one or more supervisors.
