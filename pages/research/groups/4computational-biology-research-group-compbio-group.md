### Recent Updates
Last Updated on 25/12/2021

- Our work on Accurate plant disease classification with transfer learning based on leaf images has been accepted for the 16th IEEE conference on Industrial and Automation Systems (ICIIS 2021)
- Our group members will be conducting a workshop on Explainable Machine Learning at ICIIS 2021.
- Our group members will be inovled in a workshop on Feature Engineering in Machine Learning at ICIET 2021.
- Our work on Machine Learning for detecting alzhemizers disease using Next Generation Sequencing Data has been accepted for the IEEE International Conference on Industrial and Financial Automation Systems (ICIAFS ) 2021
- We have been awarded a University of Peradeniya Researh Grant to work further on the project “Counting the uncountable : Estimating species richness from metavirome data”
- Our systematic review titled “Machine learning for plant microRNA prediction: A systematic review” is now available as a preprint.
- Our work miRNAFinder: A Comprehensive Web Resource for Plant Pre-microRNA Classification is now available as a preprint
