Wireless technology has enormous potential to change the way people and things communicate. Future wireless networks will allow people on the move to communicate with anyone, anywhere, and at any time using a range of high-performance multimedia services. Wireless and mobile networks can also enable a new class of intelligent home electronics, smart and energy-efficient buildings and highways, and in-body networks for analysis and treatment of medical conditions.

OpenFlow has been proposed as a means for researchers, network service creators, and others to easily design, test, and deploy their innovative ideas in experimental or production networks to accelerate research activities on wired or wireless network technologies. Rather than having programmability within each network node, the separated OpenFlow controller provides network control through pluggable software modules. We demonstrate the wireless control through OpenFlow controller and further attempt to incorporate it into mobile networks.
