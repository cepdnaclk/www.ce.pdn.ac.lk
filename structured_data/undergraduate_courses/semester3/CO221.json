  "objectives": "To introduce digital electronics with emphasis on practical design techniques for digital circuits, analysis of static and dynamic behaviour of digital circuits and optimized circuit implementation; its principles in Boolean algebra and the design of combinational and sequential circuits with implementation at logic circuit level. Also to teach how simple combinational and sequential modules are used to build complete systems, reflecting real-world digital design.",

    "Skill": [
      "Draw up the formal requirement specification starting from an informal requirement.",
      "Design and implement basic combinational and sequential circuits with considerations to common problems such as hazards, race conditions and instability in these circuits.",
      "Demonstrate the conformance of a design to its specifications including temporal behaviour."

    "Attitude": [
      "The student must have developed sufficient confidence to be able to undertake digital circuit design for real-world engineering requirements by acquiring any further domain knowledge through self-study.",
      "Discourage trial and error implementation of the circuits."
