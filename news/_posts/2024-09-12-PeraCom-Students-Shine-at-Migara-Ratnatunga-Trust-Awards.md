The Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Peradeniya is proud to announce that three of its students have been recognized at the prestigious Migara Ratnatunga Trust Awards on Industrial Training for University Undergraduates, presented by the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL). 

This year, out of the best 11 students awarded, two PeraCom students, Mr. Imesh Balasuriya and Ms. Isuri Devindi, secured awards of cash prizes and certificates for their outstanding performance in the Computer Engineering category. These awards were presented at the annual IESL Induction and Graduation Ceremony 2024, held at BMICH on the 23rd of July 2024. During the industrial training, Imesh worked as a Software Engineering Intern at WSO2, and Isuri worked as a Visiting Research Assistant at the School of Computing and Information Systems at Singapore Management University. Additionally, Ms. Deanna Coralage, who interned as a Cloud Engineer at Sysco Labs, received a merit certificate for her performance.

The winners and merit awardees, selected from final-year undergraduates across all state university engineering faculties in Sri Lanka, were chosen based on their presentations to the IESL selection board, which evaluated them on the technical scope of their industrial training work, presentation skills, and their performance in the Q&A session.

PeraCom is extremely proud of their achievements and wishes them continued success in their future endeavors. We hope that their accomplishments will inspire future generations to strive for excellence in their industrial training and professional careers.
