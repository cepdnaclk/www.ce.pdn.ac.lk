<p>The Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya, proudly hosted EngEx 2025, its Diamond Jubilee exhibition, from 23rd to 27th September 2025. Among the most celebrated highlights of the event, unveiling of the PeraCom Smart City, a visionary project by the Department of Computer Engineering, was selected for the ceremonial opening of the exhibition.</p>
<p>PeraCom Smart City illustrated the future of innovation, creativity, and technology. It uncovered how tomorrow&rsquo;s urban environments can be reshaped through multidisciplinary problem-solving and sustainable engineering practices. Interactive exhibits showcasing applications of artificial intelligence, real-time computing, and eco-friendly technologies were demonstrated to visitors of the Smart City.</p>
<p>The Smart City, featuring 23 exhibits, included several interactive zones designed to highlight real-world applications of technology. Visitors experienced a Smart Caf&eacute; and Smart Home, explored a VR Zone and Robotics Area, and engaged with systems addressing healthcare, agriculture, and nature. Solutions such as a Smart Hospital, Smart Agriculture Management System, Smart Environmental Management System, and Sea Pollution Control mechanisms demonstrated how engineering can offer practical answers to pressing challenges while improving quality of life.</p>
<p>The responses from the visitors including the public, the industry, and school students have been extremely positive. Many identified the Smart City as a space where innovation, creativity, and technology came alive. The exhibition zone encouraged direct engagement with real-world solutions, inspiring the younger generation to pursue engineering with passion and purpose.</p>
<p>ACES &ndash; Association of Computer Engineering Students, Hackers Club together with the academic and non-academic staff made this initiative a reality. Their tireless effort was a typical example of how student-led initiatives can create transformative experiences. The project went beyond building a model. It highlighted real solutions and inspired dialogue on sustainable innovation. It was a glimpse into the future. Students of PeraCom have proven that with imagination, teamwork, and innovation, ideas can indeed become reality.</p>
<p>At EngEx 2025, the Smart City became one of the most admired exhibits, highlighting the University of Peradeniya&rsquo;s strength in engineering education and innovation. Through projects like this, the Faculty of Engineering continues its mission to encourage problem solvers and visionaries who will lead Sri Lanka&rsquo;s technological future.<br><br>Written by: Sandali Uthpala (Junior editor/Association of Computer Engineering Students)</p>
