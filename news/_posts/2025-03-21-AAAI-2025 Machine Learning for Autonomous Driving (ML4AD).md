We are delighted to share that a student research team from the Department of Computer Engineering has won the Best Perception Paper Award at the AAAI-2025 Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving [(ML4AD) Workshop] (https://ml4ad.github.io/), held in Philadelphia, USA, on March 4th, 2025. The ML4AD Workshop is one of the most prominent global events in autonomous driving research, and this year marked its first appearance at AAAI after being part of NeurIPS for eight consecutive years. It draws leading researchers from academia and industry, including top institutions such as CMU, UIUC, Toyota Research, UBC, and UVA.

The award-winning paper, "A Spatiotemporal Approach to Tri-Perspective Representation for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction," was the only one at the event led by undergraduate first authors. It is the outcome of a Final-Year Undergraduate Project conducted at #PeraCom by Sathira Silva and Savindu Wannigama (E/17 batch). The work was supervised by Gihan Jayatilaka (E/14 batch, currently a PhD student at the University of Maryland, USA) and Prof. Roshan G. Ragel, and included collaboration with Dr. Muhammad Haris Khan from MBZUAI, UAE.

Gihan presented the paper and accepted the award on behalf of the team. Here's what he had to say:

“The chief organizer made a [LinkedIn post] (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petyushko_aaai-ml4ad-activity-7302813945524797440-3Qjr/) highlighting our work. During the award ceremony, he spent a few minutes breaking down the technical aspects—what stood out and where we could improve. It was clear the selection was made with serious consideration and technical depth.”

This is not just another best paper award. What makes it unique is where and against whom it was won—up against world-class research groups from institutions deeply embedded in the self-driving car space. The award includes $2,500 in prize money and opens doors for further engagement with the industry.

The project introduces S2TPVFormer, an extension of the Tri-Perspective View (TPVFormer) framework, by integrating temporal dynamics into the spatial-only representation. This significantly enhances 3D semantic occupancy prediction—key to real-time perception and safety in autonomous vehicles.

Achievements of this caliber reflect not only the exceptional potential and dedication of our students but also highlight the quality of mentorship, resources, and opportunities provided by the Department of Computer Engineering.

Congratulations again to our talented student researchers and their dedicated supervisors at #PeraCom on this outstanding accomplishment!
