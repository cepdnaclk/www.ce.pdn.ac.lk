We are delighted to announce that a research team from the Department of Computer Engineering has won the prestigious Best Paper Award at the AAAI-2025 Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving (ML4AD) Workshop held in Philadelphia, USA. ML4AD is an internationally recognized event that annually attracts top-tier researchers working at the forefront of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technologies. ML4AD workshop was held in conjunction with the AAAI conference for the first time, after being consecutively associated with the NeurIPS conference for the past eight years.

The award-winning paper, titled "A Spatiotemporal Approach to Tri-Perspective Representation for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction" is an outcome of a Final Year Undergraduate Project conducted at #PeraCom by undergraduate researchers Sathira Silva and Savindu Wannigama (both from the E17 batch). The project was supervised by Gihan Jayatilaka (E14 batch) and Prof. Roshan G. Ragel, , and involved collaboration with Dr. Muhammad Haris Khan. Gihan presented the paper at the ML4AD Workshop on March 4, 2025, in Philadelphia, USA, on behalf of the team.

This pioneering research extends the previously established spatial-only Tri-Perspective View framework (TPVFormer) by introducing temporal information, leading to their novel Spatio-Temporal Tri-Perspective View architecture (S2TPVFormer). Their innovative approach significantly enhances the predictive capabilities of 3D semantic occupancy models, a critical component for improving real-time perception and safety in autonomous vehicles.

Achievements of this caliber reflect not only the exceptional potential and dedication of our students but also highlight the quality of mentorship, resources, and opportunities provided by the Department of Computer Engineering.

Congratulations again to our talented student researchers and their dedicated supervisors at #PeraCom on this outstanding accomplishment!
