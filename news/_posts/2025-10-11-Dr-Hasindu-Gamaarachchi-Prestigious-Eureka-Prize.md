<p dir="ltr">We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Dr Hasindu Gamaarachchi, an alumnus of the Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya, who has been awarded the Australian Museum Eureka Prize for Outstanding Early Career Researcher.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dr Gamaarachchi&rsquo;s groundbreaking work focuses on developing scalable and efficient computing solutions that make genomic sequencing more accessible across diverse fields, including agriculture, medicine, and ecology. His research advances scientific discovery and contributes to practical solutions with far-reaching global impact.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Often described as the &ldquo;Oscars of Science&rdquo;, the Eureka Prizes honour excellence in scientific research, innovation, leadership, and communication. This achievement highlights the power of interdisciplinary research in tackling pressing global challenges and shaping the future of genomics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dr Gamaarachchi earned his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Engineering with first-class honours from the University of Peradeniya in 2015 with an award for his outstanding performance in Engineering. He went on to complete his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW Sydney in 2020, receiving the prestigious Dean&rsquo;s Award for Outstanding PhD Theses. His doctoral research was internationally recognised, securing third place in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Student Research Competition 2020, among competitors shortlisted from over 20 major ACM conferences worldwide.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are proud to celebrate Dr Gamaarachchi&rsquo;s outstanding accomplishment and wish him continued success in his remarkable journey, with the confidence that his future contributions will inspire innovation and transform lives worldwide.</p>
